# This patch enables the brightness slider in SysPrefs->Displays
# and will also enable activation of sleep mode by closing
# the laptop lid.
#
# This patch works well for laptops that have working
# ACPI methods with 64-or more levels (100 is common)
# for good support for Windows 2012 (Windows 8)
#
# Based on information from the normal laptop DSDT methods,
# optimized for use with ACPIBacklight.kext
#
# Note: This patch should be applied to the DSDT or SSDT that defines
# your integrated graphics device (always at _ADR 0x00020000)
# applied to one of the SSDTs, not DSDT.
#
# Note: Intended to be used with Windows 2012, so this should be done...
# if you previously patched for Windows 2006, undo that patch!
